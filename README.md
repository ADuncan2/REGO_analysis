# REGO_analysis
Data and code for cleaning and analysing renewable energy certificates used in the UK between 2018 and 2023

## Data sources:
- [REGO and CHP register](https://renewablesandchp.ofgem.gov.uk/) REGO reporting periods are April to May, and each year is best downloaded individually as the website is very slow.
- [Ember monthly international emissions intensity](https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/monthly-electricity-data/)
